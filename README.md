Getting and Cleaning Data
Project

The submitted files are:

	1. tidyData.txt - the tidy data set as described in the code book.
	2. run_analysis.R - the script for performing the steps to create
	   the tidyData.txt.
	3. CodeBook.md - the code book describing the variables, the data
	   and transfomations done to clean and tidy up the data.
	4. README.md - this file describing how to run the script file 
	   run_analysis.R.
	   
How to run the script:

Assumptions:
	1. run_analysis.R is in the working directory.
	2. The UCI HAR data set is in the folder named "UCI HAR Dataset"
	   in the working directory.
	3. Packages plyr and stringr are installed and available 
	   in the R environment.
	   
Steps:
	1. Open the script run_analysis.R in R Studio.
	2. Set the working directory to the one that 
	   run_analysis.R is in.
	3. Run the source.
	4. Once the run is done, the tidyData.txt file is created 
	   in the working directory.
